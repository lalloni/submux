This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 📚 Agent Instructions

**All development guidance, workflows, conventions, and best practices are documented in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).**

Claude Code should follow the instructions in AGENTS.md, which provides:
- Complete documentation structure and hierarchy
- Development commands and workflows
- Architecture quick reference with links to DESIGN.md
- Testing guidelines and infrastructure
- Configuration options reference
- Code conventions and critical rules
- Common gotchas and troubleshooting
- Getting started guide for AI agents

## Quick Links

| What You Need | Where to Find It |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Agent workflow and commands** | [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) - Start here |
| **Architecture and design** | [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) - Technical reference |
| **User documentation** | [README.md](README.md) - Quick start guide |
| **Pending work** | [TODO.md](TODO.md) - Roadmap |
| **Release history** | [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) - Changes |

## Why This Structure?

**AGENTS.md is the single source of truth for all agent instructions.** This eliminates duplication between CLAUDE.md and other agent guidance files, preventing documentation drift.

**When in doubt:** Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) → It will guide you to [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for technical details.
